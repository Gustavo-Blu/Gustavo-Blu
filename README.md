### Hi there and Welcome!!!ðŸ‘‹

I am Gustavo Allen, a fullstack software engineer and Game Developer in my free time. I love coding, it offers me a way to make things that benefit not only myself but the world around me. I graduated from Fullstack Academy in september 2021 and became a Teaching Fellow there, it's great to help students achieve their own goals the way I tried hard to achieve mine.

As of now I am working on Data Structures, algorithms, and my own personal projects to flesh out my skills

#### My favorite project right now is [PokeWar](https://github.com/bell-peppers/PokeWar) - an online multiplayer 3v3 pokemon game built using React and Firebase
